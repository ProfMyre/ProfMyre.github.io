My research focuses on producing computational tools or IoT devices that are useful for broad communities. Whenever possible, I work with undergraduate students so they can use their academic skills to develop these novel tools.\nWhen I am able to escape academia, I enjoy traveling, playing ice hockey, and getting outside climbing or exploring caves. When at home I enjoy being with my family and all kinds of \u0026ldquo;maker\u0026rdquo; hobbies (woodworking, metalworking, sewing, etc.).\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"taxonomy","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"2525497d367e79493fd32b198b28f040","permalink":"https://profmyre.github.io/authors/admin/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/authors/admin/","section":"authors","summary":"I am an assistant professor of Computer Science at the University of St. Thomas (UST) in Saint Paul, MN.
