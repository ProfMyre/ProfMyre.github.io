I am an assistant professor of Computer Science at the University of St. Thomas (UST) in Saint Paul, MN. 
		Before coming to UST, I taught at Lake Superior State University and spent two years at the University 
of Arkansas exploring and studying cave systems as an NSF Earth Sciences Postdoctoral Fellow.  Prior to that I received my 
Ph.D. in Computer Science at the University of Minnesota under David Lilja (ECE) and Martin Saar (Geophysics) where I worked on 
high-performance methods for computational fluid dynamics in the Earth sciences using graphics processing units.

I thoroughly enjoy teaching undergraduate students the joys of learning the "how and why" of computing with 
systems courses.  Collaborative research yielding computational tools or IoT devices that are useful for broad communities 
is extremely fulfilling for me.  Moreso when I am able to work with undergraduate students and can witness them use 
their academic skills to develop these novel tools.

When I am able to escape academia, I enjoy traveling, playing ice hockey, and getting outside climbing or exploring caves.  When at home I enjoy being with my family and all kinds of "maker" hobbies (woodworking, metalworking, sewing, etc.).
